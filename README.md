This is a desktop app for tracking and managing most aspects of a D&D character, including their stats, spells, inventory, and more. It uses SRD data, obtained from https://www.dnd5eapi.co, for information about spells, equipment, classes, etc, and the app allows users to add to this with custom entries.

I've built the initial version of this app using WinForms, but I am planning on creating a new UI using a different framework with which I will hopefully be able to make the app more visually interesting and potentially also cross-platform; I'm currently just evaluating which framework I want to use (at the moment, it's likely either MAUI or Avalonia).

Given WinForms' apparent limitations when it comes to developing apps that can adapt to multiple display DPIs (at least as far as I can tell, based on what I've read and my own experience), I've opted for now to just have three variations of the UI, each adjusted for a different scale factor - 100%, 125%, and 150%, represented by the number appended to the project name - with the hope that this will be sufficient to cover at least most use cases until I implement a better solution.
