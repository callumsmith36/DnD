This is a desktop app for tracking and managing most aspects of a D&D character, including stats, spells, inventory, and more. It uses SRD data, obtained from https://www.dnd5eapi.co, for information about spells, equipment, classes, etc, and allows users to add to this with custom entries.

I've built this first version of the app using WinForms, however I am planning on recreating the UI using a different framework with the intention of making it more visually interesting and potentially cross-platform. I'm currently just evaluating which framework I want to use for this (at the moment, it will likely be either MAUI or Avalonia).

Given WinForms' apparent limitations when it comes to developing apps that can adapt to multiple display DPIs (at least as far as I can tell, based on what I've read and my own experience), I've opted for now to simply have three variations of the UI, each adjusted for a different scale factor (the number appended to the project names indicates the scale in which it was designed - 100%, 125%, or 150%), with the hope that this will cover at least the majority of use cases until I implement a better solution.
